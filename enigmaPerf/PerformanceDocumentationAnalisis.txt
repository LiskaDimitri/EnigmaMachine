I have two main chock points in my program:

   1 - Least expensive of the two in resources, is the setup of the plugboard.
		(attribution of the pairs letters using a Dictionary ADT.
		
	a) with an initital position of all the rotors to 1.

		Creation & setups of pairs for plugboard: 1.762289 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for RotorI: 0.024596 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for RotorII: 0.025238 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for RotorIII: 0.025749 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for Reflector: 0.044988 ms

        b) with an initial position of all the rotors to 26.

		Creation & setups of pairs for plugboard: 1.577040 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for RotorI: 0.027401 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for RotorII: 0.038533 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for RotorIII: 0.031500 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for Reflector: 0.057426 ms

	c) with an initial position of all the rotors to 13.
		
		Creation & setups of pairs for plugboard: 1.837872 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for RotorI: 0.026953 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for RotorII: 0.029399 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for RotorIII: 0.029709 ms
		Creation & setups of pairs for Reflector: 0.097405 ms

	Here we can see that the Rotors no mater there positions are pretty constant,
	which is normal as this time comes before any change in the position.

	However, we can see that the plugboard takes noticeably more time to setup that the rotors takes.
